In the land of Waterdeep, where the towers kiss the sky,
There's a place in the North Ward, where golden dreams lie.
Wealth's the language spoken here, in coin and gem and pearl,
In the grandeur of their gilded homes, where the city's secrets unfurl.

In robes of silk and velvet, in jewels of emerald and ruby,
They dance in gilded ballrooms, a sight of beauty truly.
Their laughter rings in high-ceilinged halls, their glasses filled with cheer,
Living tales of riches vast, whispered for all to hear.

Cobbled streets beneath their feet, bathed in the moon's soft gleam,
Basking in the echoes of a bard's enchanting dream.
Tales spun of their glories past, in the air, they softly twine,
Resounding through the city walls, like a fine, aged wine.

Their wealth is not just in their gold, but in their hearts, their lore,
In the tales they've spun, the songs they've sung, the riches they adore.
In the North Ward, they find their peace, under the starry dome,
In the city of Waterdeep, where the wealthy find their home.

Through the night, their revelries echo, till the dawn's early light,
In their houses grand and opulent, under the moon's soft sight.
So raise a glass to Waterdeep, to the North Ward's gleaming spires,
To the wealthy in their silken garb, to their unquenched desires.

The tale is told, the song is sung, the bard takes his bow,
In the city of Waterdeep, under the moon's soft glow.
In the North Ward, they sleep in peace, their dreams of gold and pearl,
In the heart of Waterdeep, where the city's stories unfurl.
