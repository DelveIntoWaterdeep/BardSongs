In a world of endless chaos, where darkness reigned supreme,
A beacon of light emerged, a cleric, Amira by name.
A guardian of the faith, her holy symbol gleamed,
A servant of the gods, she'd heal and cleanse the flame.

In search of sacred power, she sought the grand divine,
To resurrect the fallen, the spell she wished to claim.
Through trials and tribulations, her destiny entwined,
With True Resurrection's might, to bring the lost from grave.

Oh, Amira, the divine, your story we shall sing,
In dungeons deep, and dragon's lair, where shadows cling.
Your radiant soul, a balm for hearts that sorrow brings,
Oh, Amira, the divine, your name shall forever ring.

With mace and shield, she battled fiends, and darkness she dispelled,
Her blessings, like a shield of light, protected friends from harm.
Her prayers invoked the heavens, in celestial tongues she excelled,
With grace and wisdom she prevailed, her spirit bright and warm.

Through ancient tombs and crypts, her journey led her forth,
The secrets of the ages, she sought to understand.
And with each step, her purpose grew, her spirit gaining force,
To wield the power of life, and guide the souls of man.

Oh, Amira, the divine, your story we shall sing,
In dungeons deep, and dragon's lair, where shadows cling.
Your radiant soul, a balm for hearts that sorrow brings,
Oh, Amira, the divine, your name shall forever ring.

In the end, she found the power, a gift from gods above,
True Resurrection's secrets, to heal the deepest pain.
Now legends tell of Amira, the cleric we all love,
Her tale of strength and valor, forever shall remain.
