(Softly, Slowly)
As darkness dons her velvet cloak, and day gives way to night,
In the forest to the South of Waterdeep, there's a curious sight.
Just a few small insects flit, dancing in the air,
In the quiet of the evening, their light seems barely there.

(Building Crescendo)
Blink, blink, in the stillness, a symphony of light,
Blink, blink, in the darkness, a spectacle so bright.
Fireflies in the night sky, their dance a silent song,
In the forest south of Waterdeep, where shadows stretch so long.

(Quicken Tempo)
From the trees and nearby grasses, more join this tiny band,
Their light a glowing testament, across the shadowed land.
With each flash, the night comes alive, the darkness fully settles in,
In the forest south of Waterdeep, the dance of night begins.

(Faster, Louder)
Blink, blink, in the moonlight, a ballet on the breeze,
Blink, blink, through the night air, dancing with such ease.
Fireflies in the forest, their dance a sight to see,
In the land south of Waterdeep, a mesmerizing spree.

(Tempo Peaks)
In the heart of the forest, under the sky's starry sheen,
A spectacle of fireflies, lighting up the scene.
From the South Gate of Waterdeep, a sight that truly gleams,
The dance of the fireflies, more magical than dreams.

(Fast and Joyful)
Blink, blink, in the starlight, each flash a dancer's leap,
Blink, blink, in the forest, where secrets the night does keep.
Fireflies twirl and flutter, in a dance that's truly bright,
In the forest south of Waterdeep, a dazzling delight.

(Slowly, Softly)
As the night gives way to dawn, the dance begins to wane,
The fireflies retreat to rest, until night comes again.
In the forest south of Waterdeep, under the moon's soft light,
They'll dance again, those fireflies, when day gives way to night.
