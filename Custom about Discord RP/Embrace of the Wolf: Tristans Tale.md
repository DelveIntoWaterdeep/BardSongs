In the heart of the realm, a tale we unfold,
Of a hero named Tristan, so valiant and bold.
A warrior of virtue, with a secret embraced,
He battles the werewolf that within him is placed.

Oh, Tristan the Brave, he must keep his control,
For the beast that resides, in the depths of his soul.
A fight waged within, a struggle untamed,
His destiny lies, in the balance, unnamed.

With a flaming blade, that dances and gleams,
He vanquishes foes, as the firelight beams.
No longer concealed, his truth is now shown,
The werewolf's curse, a part of his own.

Underneath the full moon's light,
His transformation, a fearsome sight.
Yet he stands tall, no shame to bear,
For he is Tristan, the wolf who dares.

In dungeons and battles, he sings of his plight,
With lyrical magic, he'll make wrongs right.
Embracing the beast, no longer he hides,
A hero reborn, with the wolf by his side.

Oh, Tristan the Brave, he has gained his control,
For the beast that resides, in the depths of his soul.
A harmony forged, two forces combined,
His destiny now clear, as their fates intertwine.
