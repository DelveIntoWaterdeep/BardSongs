Well, this one's about, an old tale to ignite,
Of the Guardian, yeah, in the Feywild's twilight.
She's a unicorn pure, mane of gold, so bright,
Guarding Neverlight Grove, she's a dazzling sight.

Guardian of Neverlight, you're burning through the night,
Like a comet, you're racing, a majestic flight!
Guardian of Neverlight, oh, you're a wonder quite,
With hooves of thunder, and courage at its height.

In the Fey's mystic wood, she's an epic song,
A sentinel firm, where the wild belong.
Through the moon's gentle glow, she strides along,
Defender of the Neverlight, forever strong.

Guardian of Neverlight, you're gleaming in the moonlight,
Your golden mane, oh, outshines the starlight.
Guardian of Neverlight, a sight so right,
In the Feywild's twilight, you're the beacon bright.

She's the keeper of sacred, the Feywild's treasure trove,
A spirit brave, with the serenity of a dove.
Of her, the tales are woven, and proudly rove,
Guardian of Neverlight, a symbol of pure love.

Guardian of Neverlight, you're a marvel in the night,
In the mystic Grove, you're the ultimate delight.
Guardian of Neverlight, your aura's white,
A unicorn of legend, in eternal flight.

She's the guardian, the guardian, Guardian of Neverlight,
Unicorn white, in the Feywild's moonlight.
She's the guardian, the guardian, a sight so bright,
Guardian of Neverlight, our hero, our knight!
