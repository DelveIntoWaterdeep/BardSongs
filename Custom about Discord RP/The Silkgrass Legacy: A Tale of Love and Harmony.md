In a land of myth and legend, in a time of long ago,
Two heroes roamed the countryside, putting on a wondrous show.
Tegan the halfling bard, with voice like honeyed wine,
And Sivelle, her druid wife, whose magic did entwine.

The Silkgrass duo traveled far, their hearts as one did beat,
With Sivelle's unicorn totem, they healed those in defeat.
From town to town, they brought their gifts, a menagerie so grand,
A myriad of creatures, in harmony, they'd command.

Oh, gather 'round and listen close, my friends, to their tale unfold,
Of a menagerie that defied the odds, and stories yet untold.
With laughter, love, and healing touch, the Silkgrass pair did thrive,
As Tegan and Sivelle walked hand in hand, through life's great journey, side by side.

In every village, people gathered, to see their wondrous feats,
As Tegan's voice rose high and clear, enchanting all who'd meet.
Sivelle's healing power, with her unicorn by her side,
Restored the weary, mended the broken, and filled hearts with pride.

Together they faced the darkest nights, with courage in their hearts,
Their love a beacon shining bright, a light that never parts.
Oh, the Silkgrass duo, strong and true, their legend grows with time,
Their menagerie a symbol of unity, as creatures live, combined.

Oh, gather 'round and listen close, my friends, to their tale unfold,
Of a menagerie that defied the odds, and stories yet untold.
With laughter, love, and healing touch, the Silkgrass pair did thrive,
As Tegan and Sivelle walked hand in hand, through life's great journey, side by side.

Now, as the sun sets on their days, their tale will never fade,
For in our hearts, the Silkgrass love, forever will be laid.
So sing along, dear friends of mine, and raise your voice up high,
For Tegan and Sivelle's legacy, forever in the sky.
