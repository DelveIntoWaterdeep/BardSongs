Gather 'round, good folk, and listen close,
To a tale of a duel, betwixt heroes bold,
On a sun-kissed shore, the stage was set,
For a clash of champions, the likes untold.

Oh, sing of Brody, the human might,
A sashed Battlemage, a wondrous sight,
And Zylrie, the sea elf, nimble and swift,
A monk of the sea, with a powerful gift.

Zylrie, the sea elf, with eyes agleam,
Did challenge our Brody, to test her skill,
A spar she sought, a trial of strength,
To hone her training, and bend to her will.

Oh, sing of Brody, the human might,
A sashed Battlemage, a wondrous sight,
And Zylrie, the sea elf, nimble and swift,
A monk of the sea, with a powerful gift.

On the sandy beach, they danced and dueled,
Each blow exchanged, a testament of might,
Zylrie's fists of fury, they struck true,
But Brody's armor and spear shone in the light.

A dance of combat, a test of skill,
The tide roared on, as time stood still,
A clash of spirits, an ode to the brave,
A story for the ages, a memory to save.

In the end, 'twas Brody who prevailed,
His spear and armor, a force too grand,
Zylrie, the sea elf, tasted defeat,
As she found herself face down in the sand.

Oh, sing of Brody, the human might,
A sashed Battlemage, a wondrous sight,
And Zylrie, the sea elf, nimble and swift,
A monk of the sea, with a powerful gift.

So, let us toast to their bravery, friends,
And celebrate the tale of their noble fight,
For in the annals of heroes, their names shall live,
And forever, their stories shall take flight.
