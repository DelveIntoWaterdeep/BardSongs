In Waterdeep, where the seagulls play,
And the market's alive at break of day,
Traders shout and children laugh,
In the heart of the city, life's not half.

Look, there goes Mister Baker's son,
With a fresh baked loaf for everyone,
And there's Miss Weaver with her wool so bright,
Weaving dreams in the morning light.

(Chorus)
So let's dance, let's dance, in the market square,
With the scent of spices in the air,
In Waterdeep, under the sun so fair,
Life is merry, without a care.
