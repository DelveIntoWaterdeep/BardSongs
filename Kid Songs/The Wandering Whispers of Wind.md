Can you hear the whispers of the Wind, my dear,
As it wanders through Waterdeep, far and near?
It carries tales of the city, old and new,
In its gentle sighs, a story brews.

(Chorus)
Listen, oh listen, to the whispering Wind,
Through the streets of Waterdeep, it has twinned,
With a sigh and a tale, it's forever pinned,
In the heart of the city, it's forever grinned.
