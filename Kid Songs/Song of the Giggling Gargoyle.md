In the heart of Waterdeep, under the twilight's glow,
There's a gargoyle who laughs, a sound soft and low,
Children gather 'round, as the day begins to wane,
Listening to the giggles, like sweet, soft rain.

(Chorus)
Giggle, giggle, gargoyle stone,
In the city of wonders, you're not alone,
Your laughter is a gentle tone,
In the heart of Waterdeep, our home.
