In the city of Waterdeep, as dusk begins to creep,
Young heroes come alive, while the city starts to sleep.
They're the lamplighters, brave and true,
Lighting up the night, for me and you.

Lamplighters, lamplighters, lighting up the way,
Guiding us safely, keeping the dark at bay,
With your lanterns bright, you turn night into day,
Lamplighters, lamplighters, heroes of the fray.

They walk the cobbled streets, under the moon's soft glow,
With their lanterns held high, casting a gentle show.
Their light dances on the walls, chasing shadows away,
Guiding the night into the break of day.

Lamplighters, lamplighters, with your light so bright,
You turn Waterdeep's streets into a beautiful sight,
With your courage and your light, you fight the night,
Lamplighters, lamplighters, heroes of the light.

When danger lurks around, in the city's deep dark corners,
Our lamplighters stand strong, they're not mere mourners.
With their light and courage, they keep the city safe,
Their heroism and bravery, no one can chafe.

Lamplighters, lamplighters, heroes of the night,
With your lanterns bright, you put up a fight,
Against the dark, you shine so bright,
Lamplighters, lamplighters, you are our light.

So here's to the lamplighters, the heroes of Waterdeep,
Who guard our city, while we sleep.
With their lanterns bright, they light the way,
The heroes of Waterdeep, to whom we say:

Lamplighters, lamplighters, heroes so bright,
In the heart of Waterdeep, you light up the night,
With your courage and your light, you're a beautiful sight,
Lamplighters, lamplighters, our shining light.
