High above the world so wide, in Happy Meadows, Rain resides,
On fluffy clouds where she likes to hide, with fiery wings by her side.
She's got a tiny halo, round her horn so bright,
Shimmering in the sunlight, a truly magical sight.

Rain, Rain, in the sky so high,
With your cupcakes sweet and your head held high,
Your rainbow magic can never lie,
Transforming the evil with a sigh.

Rain loves her cupcakes, oh so sweet,
A treat she'll gladly, readily eat.
She takes them as gifts, with a smile so warm,
In Happy Meadows, away from the storm.

When bullies come, or evildoers near,
Rain stands tall, she knows no fear.
From her haloed horn, a rainbow springs,
Filling the air with color, among other things.

Rain, Rain, with your halo so bright,
Your fiery wings reflect the light,
Your rainbow magic shines in the night,
Turning wrong into right.

The rainbow's power, so strange, so rare,
Heals friendly creatures with gentle care.
But to those who harm, or cause despair,
She turns them into flowers, fair.

Rain, Rain, in the sky so high,
With your cupcakes sweet and your head held high,
Your rainbow magic can never lie,
In Happy Meadows, you forever lie.

With fiery wings and a halo so bright,
Rain's a sight of pure delight.
In Happy Meadows, away from strife,
She sings her song, full of life.

Rain, Rain, with your magic so grand,
Turning the evil into a flowered land,
In your presence, we understand,
The power of love, so hand in hand.
