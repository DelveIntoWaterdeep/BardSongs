In the bustling streets of Waterdeep,
Where secrets and stories steep,
Lives a jolly jester with a jest so sweet,
That makes everyone tap their feet.

He wears a hat with a jingling bell,
And spins tales no one else can tell,
Of dragons, knights and magic spells,
In the heart of the city we know so well.

(Chorus)
Laugh, oh laugh, with the jester so jolly,
In Waterdeep, where life's a folly,
With a jest and a jingle, and a holly dolly,
Life's a merry, jolly rolly-polly.
