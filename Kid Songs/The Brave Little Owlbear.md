In the wilds near Waterdeep, in a forest dense and deep,
Lives a little owlbear, who never falls asleep.
He's brave and he's strong, with a heart so pure,
His courage and kindness, there's no cure.

(Chorus)
Roar, oh roar, little owlbear,
In the wilds near Waterdeep, without a care,
Your courage is a story, rare,
In the heart of the forest, it's a fair.
