In the world so wide, and the city so deep,
Where Rain, Coral, and Sheldon sleep,
And the Giggling Gargoyle, on his stony keep,
We weave a tale, that'll make you leap.

Rain, Coral, Sheldon, and the Gargoyle so jolly,
In our city Waterdeep, away from folly,
Your stories light up our lives, by golly,
Making every day a holly dolly.

Rain, with her fiery wings and horn so bright,
Showering rainbows, a truly magical sight,
Coral, in the sea and the sky so blue,
With her rainbow tail, and her heart so true.

Rain, Coral, Sheldon, and the Gargoyle so fine,
In our city Waterdeep, under the sunshine,
Your tales of magic, intertwine,
Creating a melody, oh so divine.

Sheldon, the dragon, with his love for blueberries,
And his wings of cyan, flying over prairies,
And the Giggling Gargoyle, with his laugh so merry,
In the heart of Waterdeep, where we ferry.

Rain, Coral, Sheldon, and the Gargoyle so grand,
In our city Waterdeep, hand in hand,
Your stories inspire, across the land,
The magic of friendship, forever stand.

Now, as the sun dips low, and the stars take flight,
We end our concert, under the moonlight.
With Rain, Coral, Sheldon, and the Gargoyle, oh so bright,
We say goodnight, with delight.

Rain, Coral, Sheldon, and the Gargoyle so dear,
In our city Waterdeep, we cheer,
For your stories of magic, far and near,
Till next time, we'll hold you near.```
