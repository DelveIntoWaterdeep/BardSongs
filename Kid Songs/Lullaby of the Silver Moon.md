As the sun dips low and the stars peek out,
In Waterdeep, there's no room for doubt,
The silver moon begins to climb,
Whispering tales of a time so prime.

In the gentle glow, the city sleeps,
While the silver moon her vigil keeps,
She sings a song so sweet, so deep,
A lullaby for Waterdeep.

(Chorus)
Sleep, oh sleep, under the moon so bright,
In the arms of the gentle night,
Dream of adventures, take your flight,
Under the silver moon's soft light.
