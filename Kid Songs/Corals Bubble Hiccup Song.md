Deep in the ocean, high in the clouds,
Lives a creature, enchanting crowds,
Her name is Coral, oh so bright,
Her rainbow tail is a beautiful sight.

Coral, Coral, in the sea and the sky,
With your cookies sweet and spirits high,
Your magical tail lights up the night,
Turning darkness into light.

Cookies are her favorite, a delightful snack,
In the ocean deep or the cloud's fluffy pack,
She shares them with friends, with a heart so kind,
In the sea or the sky, a friend you'll find.

Coral has a power, oh so rare,
She bolsters creatures, with gentle care,
Bestowing upon animals, the power to speak,
In their own voice, unique and meek.

Coral, Coral, in the sky so blue,
Your powers are amazing, and oh so true,
Your rainbow tail, in the ocean's hue,
Brings joy to us, and to the animals too.

When Coral is upset, her tail lights glow,
A rainbow of colors, a magical show,
With a smack of her tail, a force unfolds,
Engulfing enemies, in its magical holds.

Coral, Coral, with your tail so bright,
You light up the ocean, you light up the night,
Your power is a truly amazing sight,
Making everything just feel right.

And when Coral hiccups, oh what a sight,
Bubbles shoot from her horn, to a great height,
Turning into cookies, glitter, and gas,
Protecting friends, as the enemies pass.

Coral, Coral, in the sea and the sky,
With your bubbles of magic, flying high,
Your power of love, can never lie,
In the ocean or clouds, you forever lie.

With cookies, glitter, and a gas so stinky,
Coral's powers are quite kinky,
In the ocean or the sky, wherever she may be,
Coral's song is a melody, full of glee.

Coral, Coral, with your heart so grand,
Turning enemies to dust, on sea or on land,
In your presence, we understand,
The power of love, is oh so grand.
