In Luskan town, where the wind blows cold,
A bard named Darryl, brave and bold,
He played the lute with fingers fine,
His melodies could turn water to wine.

One day, a stranger strolled into town,
He had a wicked grin and a dark, dark frown,
He said, "I've heard about your fame,
And I'm here to challenge you to a game."

And the stranger said, "My name is Mephisto, and I've come from the Nine Hells,
I've heard you're the finest lute player, and I'm here to test your skills,
Now you play a pretty good lute, boy, but give the devil his due,
I bet a lute of gold against your soul, 'cause I think I'm better than you."

Darryl said, "My name's Darryl, and it may be a sin,
But I'll take your bet, you're gonna regret, 'cause I'm the best there's ever been."

Darryl, tune up your lute and play your music hard,
'Cause hell's broke loose in Luskan and the devil deals the cards,
And if you win, you get this shiny lute made of gold,
But if you lose, the devil gets your soul.

Mephisto opened up his case and said, "I'll start this show,"
And fire flew from his fingertips as he strummed a wicked chord,
And he plucked the strings with a fiendish grin, and it made an evil hiss,
And a band of demons joined in, and it sounded something like this.

When Mephisto finished, Darryl said, "Well, you're pretty good, old son,
But sit down in that chair right there, and let me show you how it's done."

"Fire in the Luskan docks, run, boys, run,
Mephisto's in the house with a lute of gold,
Darryl in the shadows, pickin' out notes,
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no."

Mephisto bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat,
And he laid that golden lute on the ground at Darryl's feet,
Darryl said, "Mephisto, just come on back if you ever want to try again,
I done told you once, you son of a fiend, I'm the best there's ever been."

And he played, "Fire in the Luskan docks, run, boys, run,
Mephisto's in the house with a lute of gold,
Darryl in the shadows, pickin' out notes,
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no."

Now the tale of Darryl spread far and wide,
A hero of Luskan, he filled hearts with pride,
His lute played sweet and his voice rang clear,
And folks would gather from far and near.

But Mephisto, he vowed to return one day,
To challenge Darryl and take his soul away,
But the bard stood firm and he didn't fear,
He knew his lute would protect what he held dear.

So he sang, "Fire in the Luskan docks, run, boys, run,
Mephisto's in the shadows with his plans unfold,
Darryl in the spotlight, pickin' out notes,
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no."

Years went by and Darryl's legend grew,
His golden lute shined bright and true,
Then one stormy night, a dark figure appeared,
It was Mephisto, just as Darryl had feared.

He said, "Darryl, I'm back, and I've learned some new tricks,
It's time to settle this, once and for all, let's pick,"
Darryl stood tall and he didn't cower,
He said, "Bring it on, I'll show you my power."

And they played, "Fire in the Luskan docks, run, boys, run,
Mephisto's back in town with a score to settle,
Darryl and the devil, dueling with notes,
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no."

The music rang out, fierce and loud,
The people of Luskan gathered in a crowd,
But when the last note was finally played,
It was clear who'd won, who'd made the grade.

Mephisto's head hung low, defeated and done,
He knew he'd lost, and Darryl had won,
With a flash of fire, he disappeared,
And the people of Luskan all raised a cheer.

For they sang, "Fire in the Luskan docks, run, boys, run,
Mephisto's been defeated, the battle is won,
Darryl, our hero, standing so bold,
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no."

Now Darryl's fame reached beyond the skies,
A lute-strumming legend, a hero in their eyes,
His golden lute and his melodies sweet,
A testament to the devil's defeat.

Mephisto, he roamed the Nine Hells, full of shame,
But he never forgot Darryl's name,
In the darkness, he plotted, his rage did seethe,
For he couldn't accept that he'd been beat.

But they sang, "Fire in the Luskan docks, run, boys, run,
Mephisto's in the shadows, nursing his pride,
Darryl, our hero, the best there's ever been,
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no."

So remember the tale of Darryl and his lute,
How he faced the devil and took his golden loot,
In Luskan town, where the wind still blows cold,
The legend of the lute strummer will forever be told.

For in the face of evil, Darryl stood strong,
With his golden lute and his heart full of song,
And if Mephisto dares to come back one day,
Darryl will be ready, to keep the devil at bay.

And they'll sing, "Fire in the Luskan docks, run, boys, run,
Mephisto's no match for our hero, so bold,
Darryl, the lute strummer, forever we'll sing,
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no."

So, let this tale be a lesson to all,
In the face of darkness, stand tall,
For when music and courage combine as one,
Even the devil himself can be undone.
