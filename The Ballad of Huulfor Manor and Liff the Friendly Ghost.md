In the land of old and yonder, where the winds of stories blow,
Lies the Huulfor Manor grand, where the spirits come and go,
In Waterdeep's fair Trades Ward, where the busy markets thrive,
Just across the City of the Dead, where the buried secrets lie.

Oh, the Huulfor Manor haunted, where the friendly spirits dwell,
In the taproom, they will greet you, with a tale or two to tell,
Liff the ghost, so full of mischief, yet a friend to all who come,
In the heart of Waterdeep, where the living and the dead become one.

Through the creaking doors and hallways, shadows dance upon the walls,
And the whispers of the past, echo through the ancient halls,
In the taproom, tales are spun, with a laughter light and free,
As Liff the ghost regales the guests, with tales of history.

And as the moonlight graces, the cobblestones outside,
The spirits of the City of the Dead, gather at the fireside,
In the warmth of Huulfor Manor, where the living and the dead unite,
Sharing tales of joy and sorrow, as they laugh away the night.

Oh, the Huulfor Manor haunted, where the friendly spirits dwell,
In the taproom, they will greet you, with a tale or two to tell,
Liff the ghost, so full of mischief, yet a friend to all who come,
In the heart of Waterdeep, where the living and the dead become one.

So raise a toast to Huulfor Manor, in the heart of Waterdeep,
Where the spirits of the past, their eternal watch shall keep,
And should you find yourself, in the taproom late at night,
You'll be greeted by dear Liff, with a tale and a ghostly smile.
