In the heart of the jungle, the forests of Chult,
A lonely wanderer roamed, with courage and cult,
His lute by his side, a melody he strummed,
Through treacherous paths, he bravely hummed.

Oh, lonely wanderer, your song echoes through the night,
In the forests of Chult, you're a beacon of light,
With your melodies pure, and your spirit so bold,
You'll conquer the shadows, and stories untold.

Ancient ruins he sought, secrets veiled in green,
A tale of forgotten kingdoms, unheard and unseen,
He battled the monsters, with his music and charm,
A soothing enchantment, disarming all harm.

Oh, lonely wanderer, your song echoes through the night,
In the forests of Chult, you're a beacon of light,
With your melodies pure, and your spirit so bold,
You'll conquer the shadows, and stories untold.

In the depths of the forest, a mystical glade,
A shimmering pool, where his lute he played,
He sung to the spirits, and they whispered their lore,
Revealing the secrets, of Chult's ancient core.

With newfound knowledge, the wanderer rose,
He continued his journey, facing countless foes,
From the dread Omu ruins, to the heart of the tomb,
His songs pierced the darkness, dispelling the gloom.

Oh, lonely wanderer, your song echoes through the night,
In the forests of Chult, you're a beacon of light,
With your melodies pure, and your spirit so bold,
You'll conquer the shadows, and stories untold.

Now legends are sung, of the lonely bard's quest,
In the forests of Chult, he passed every test,
His lute still resounds, through the canopy tall,
A reminder of courage, to inspire us all.
