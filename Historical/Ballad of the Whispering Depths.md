Gather 'round, dear friends, and lend me your ears,
I sing to you a tale of wonder, magic, and fears,
A labyrinth lies beneath Waterdeep's streets,
The Undermountain awaits, where shadows and secrets meet.

Oh, the Undermountain whispers, calling us below,
To venture in its depths, where ancient secrets grow,
For glory, gold, and fame, brave souls will tread,
In the heart of Waterdeep, where the Undermountain's dread.

Within its winding halls, danger lurks unseen,
Where monsters, traps, and treasure hide, in darkness pristine,
A challenge for the worthy, a siren's call for the brave,
In the depths of the Undermountain, destiny's path is paved.

Oh, the Undermountain whispers, calling us below,
To venture in its depths, where ancient secrets grow,
For glory, gold, and fame, brave souls will tread,
In the heart of Waterdeep, where the Undermountain's dread.

Mighty heroes of old, their names echo through time,
Adventurers who dared, into the darkness they'd climb,
Through trials and tribulations, their legends were cast,
In the hallowed halls of Undermountain, their tales forever last.

So heed the call, adventurers, and let your spirits ignite,
For the riches and the stories, within the eternal night,
Face the dangers, fearsome and grand, that lie ahead,
In the bowels of the Undermountain, where only the strong are led.

Oh, the Undermountain whispers, calling us below,
To venture in its depths, where ancient secrets grow,
For glory, gold, and fame, brave souls will tread,
In the heart of Waterdeep, where the Undermountain's dread.

And when you emerge, victorious and worn,
With treasures untold and legends reborn,
Sing the ballad of the Whispering Depths, far and wide,
Of the Undermountain's allure, where adventure resides.
