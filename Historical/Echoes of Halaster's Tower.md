Gather 'round, brave souls, and listen close,
A tale of darkness, magic, and the madman's ghost,
Beneath Waterdeep's bustling streets, lies a buried tower,
The ancient realm of Halaster Blackcloak, an arcane power.

In the shadows of the Undermountain, where Halaster's echoes linger,
Dare to descend, adventurers, and unveil the buried splendor,
Through twisted halls and chambers deep, magic courses still,
In the remnants of the mad wizard's tower, where fate and fortune spill.

Halaster's madness filled the air, his tower a living maze,
The Undermountain formed, a labyrinth for the end of days,
His magic lives on, in every trap and monster that awaits,
For those who dare to challenge the depths, and tempt the hands of fate.

In the shadows of the Undermountain, where Halaster's echoes linger,
Dare to descend, adventurers, and unveil the buried splendor,
Through twisted halls and chambers deep, magic courses still,
In the remnants of the mad wizard's tower, where fate and fortune spill.

Heroes have come and gone, their stories etched in stone,
Yet the mad wizard's legacy remains, a challenge all their own,
From ancient halls and hidden vaults, secrets whisper and call,
In the echoes of Halaster's Tower, where mysteries enthrall.

Venture forth, brave heroes, into the heart of the abyss,
Face the darkness, traps, and monsters, and Halaster's lurking kiss,
Claim your place in legend, in the depths where magic thrives,
In the Undermountain's whispering halls, where history comes alive.

In the shadows of the Undermountain, where Halaster's echoes linger,
Dare to descend, adventurers, and unveil the buried splendor,
Through twisted halls and chambers deep, magic courses still,
In the remnants of the mad wizard's tower, where fate and fortune spill.

And when you return, triumphant and bold,
With tales of the Undermountain, and the mad wizard of old,
Sing the song of Halaster's Tower, a testament to the brave,
For within the depths of the Undermountain, legends are engraved.
