On a stormy coastline, where waves doth break,
There's a tale of Umberlee, the sea elves' grace.
For this Goddess of the Sea, so fierce and wild,
With her watery whip, she rules the tides.

Oh, Umberlee, hear our humble plea,
Guide the sea elves through the waves so free.
In your watery domain, our fates entwine,
Mistress of the Sea, we sing in rhyme.

In the depths of oceans, the sea elves dwell,
Worshipping Umberlee, with songs they tell.
Her power and her might, command the seas,
As they chant her name, they bend their knees.

Oh, Umberlee, hear our humble plea,
Guide the sea elves through the waves so free.
In your watery domain, our fates entwine,
Mistress of the Sea, we sing in rhyme.

Her tempests and her calm, both intertwined,
A balance she maintains, a force divine.
Through storms and tranquil seas, she guides our way,
A beacon in the night, and light of day.

Oh, Umberlee, hear our humble plea,
Guide the sea elves through the waves so free.
In your watery domain, our fates entwine,
Mistress of the Sea, we sing in rhyme.

Now we sing this hymn, in reverence and awe,
To Umberlee, our protector, and much more.
May her tides forever ebb and flow,
As we sea elves journey, through the world below.
