Come gather 'round and hear my tale,
Of a city's secrets, hidden well.
Where the dead rest in their silent beds,
And the living tread with cautious steps.

Silent stones of Waterdeep,
Guard the memories of those who sleep.
Their stories etched in stone and bone,
Whispered by the wind and moan.

Here lie the Masked Lords of old,
Their tombs adorned with wealth untold.
And founders of the city fair,
Whose names and deeds we still revere.

Silent stones of Waterdeep,
Guard the memories of those who sleep.
Their stories etched in stone and bone,
Whispered by the wind and moan.

But beware, adventurer bold,
For danger lurks in the city's hold.
The undead rise, the shadows creep,
And secrets hidden deep.

Silent stones of Waterdeep,
Guard the memories of those who sleep.
Their stories etched in stone and bone,
Whispered by the wind and moan.

So heed my warning, and stay on guard,
In the City of the Dead, where legends are scarred.
