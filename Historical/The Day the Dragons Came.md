In the time of old, in the days of yore,
A tale was told, of dragon lore.
They came from the sky, on a fateful day,
In a blaze of fire, they joined the fray.

Oh, the day the dragons came, aflame with rage and ire,
Our world was never the same, consumed by dragon fire.
Oh, the day the dragons swooped, their roars filled the air,
Our courage in a loop, against their fiery glare.

With scales of steel, and eyes of flame,
Bearing teeth of zeal, no man could tame.
They soared so high, then dove so low,
Under the crimson sky, they cast a fiery glow.

Oh, the day the dragons came, our swords against their might,
In the annals of our fame, we fought the endless night.
Oh, the day the dragons roared, their cries split the sky,
In songs and tales, we've stored, the day they flew so high.

In the face of fear, we held our ground,
With every tear, a resolve was found.
Against their wrath, we stood so brave,
In the aftermath, a new world we'd pave.

Oh, the day the dragons came, a memory etched in time,
Our world wrapped in flame, a mountain we would climb.
Oh, the day the dragons fell, their reign at last undone,
In our hearts, the story dwell, of the battle that was won.

And so ends the tale, of the day so grim,
In every ale, we toast to them.
To the day the dragons came, to the heroes of our land,
In every flame, their memory stands.
