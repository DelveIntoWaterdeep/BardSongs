Oh, gather 'round, my friends, and hear,
A tale of woe and dread, I fear,
Of the cursed road 'twixt cities grand,
Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep do stand.

On the open road, we'll face our plight,
Through darkest day and blackest night,
With every step, our courage tried,
On the dismal path where dangers hide.

Now, between the cities lies a trail,
Wrought with peril, a harrowing tale,
Goblins lurking, bandits sneering,
Monsters stalking, and doom, we're nearing.

On the open road, we'll face our plight,
Through darkest day and blackest night,
With every step, our courage tried,
On the dismal path where dangers hide.

Oh, the wind it howls, the rain it pours,
We march on through the thunder's roars,
No taverns warm, no beds to rest,
This cursed road, a daunting test.

Our spirits low, our bodies frail,
Yet still we press on, lest we fail,
Through haunted woods and murky fen,
We strive to reach our journey's end.

On the open road, we'll face our plight,
Through darkest day and blackest night,
With every step, our courage tried,
On the dismal path where dangers hide.

And so, my friends, our tale unfolds,
Of heroes bold and villains cold,
Remember well this bard's lament,
And pray you never face such torment.
