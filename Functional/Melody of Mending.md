In the forge of time and battles past,
Our gear has worn, but it shall not be our last.
With nimble hands and deft enchantment strong,
We'll mend the pieces that to us belong.

Oh, sing of the bard who mends what's torn,
A melody of strength, as the gear's reborn.
With hammer and anvil, string and spell,
We'll weave the magic that makes our arms excel.
