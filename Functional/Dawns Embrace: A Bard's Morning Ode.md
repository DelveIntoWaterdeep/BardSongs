Awake, my friends, the dawn is here,
A brand new day, let's give a cheer!
With morning light, our quest begins,
Adventure calls, and fortune grins.

Oh, we rise with the sun, our journey's just begun,
Together we'll face the day, our fears we'll keep at bay,
With laughter, joy, and song, we'll keep our spirits strong,
A merry band of travelers, as the world unfolds before us.

The birds are singing, sweet and clear,
Their melodies for all to hear.
With hope in hearts, we'll forge ahead,
Bound by fate, by friendship led.

Oh, we rise with the sun, our journey's just begun,
Together we'll face the day, our fears we'll keep at bay,
With laughter, joy, and song, we'll keep our spirits strong,
A merry band of travelers, as the world unfolds before us.

So sing along, my dear companions,
As we welcome the morning's bright expansions,
For every day brings a chance anew,
To seek our fortunes, and dreams pursue.
