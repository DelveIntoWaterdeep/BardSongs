In forests deep and meadows wide,
A world of wonders there reside,
Where nature's secrets are unveiled,
And ancient stories are regaled.

Oh, forests, meadows, and wide-open places,
With beauty and mystery, our hearts they embrace us,
We sing of the freedom, the wind in our faces,
In forests, meadows, and wide-open places.

Through dappled sunlight, shadows dance,
As whispering winds the leaves entrance,
And creatures of myth frolic and play,
In the magic that's found both night and day.

Oh, forests, meadows, and wide-open places,
With beauty and mystery, our hearts they embrace us,
We sing of the freedom, the wind in our faces,
In forests, meadows, and wide-open places.

A symphony of life, the land sings its tune,
A harmony of flora, by the light of the moon,
The tales of the ages, the wisdom of sages,
Are etched in the trees, and sung by the breezes.

From rolling hills to river's edge,
The land reveals its sacred pledge,
To share its bounty, gift, and grace,
With all who walk in its embrace.

Oh, forests, meadows, and wide-open places,
With beauty and mystery, our hearts they embrace us,
We sing of the freedom, the wind in our faces,
In forests, meadows, and wide-open places.

So let us journey, hand in hand,
Through forests, meadows, and this vast land,
In reverence and wonder, we'll find our place,
In forests, meadows, and wide-open spaces.
