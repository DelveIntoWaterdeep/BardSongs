In the land of Abeir-Toril, where the stories are woven,
There lived a brave dragon slayer, her name was Seraphine.
A skilled and fearless warrior, her tales were often spoken,
But none could know the love that bloomed, a secret to be seen.

Oh Seraphine, the dragon slayer, bravest of the bold,
She ventured far and faced great beasts, her legend to be told.
But in her heart, a love so deep, the world had yet to know,
She fell in love with Zephyros, the dragon of winds that blow.

With eyes like shimmering sapphires and scales of azure hue,
Zephyros, the dragon mighty, ruled the skies with grace.
His heart was pure, his wisdom vast, and though the world he flew,
He found his solace in the bond with Seraphine's embrace.

Oh Seraphine, the dragon slayer, bravest of the bold,
She ventured far and faced great beasts, her legend to be told.
But in her heart, a love so deep, the world had yet to know,
She fell in love with Zephyros, the dragon of winds that blow.

Through battles fierce and dangers dire, their love remained steadfast,
For Seraphine and Zephyros, a love that was meant to last.
Two worlds entwined, their hearts combined, a secret love they bore,
And in their union, they would find a peace not known before.

As years rolled by and seasons changed, their love grew ever strong,
Defying odds and breaking bounds, a testament to their will.
In harmony, they lived their lives, together they belonged,
And in the annals of Abeir-Toril, their tale lives on still.

Oh Seraphine, the dragon slayer, bravest of the bold,
She ventured far and faced great beasts, her legend to be told.
But in her heart, a love so deep, the world had yet to know,
She fell in love with Zephyros, the dragon of winds that blow.

So let us sing of Seraphine, the dragon slayer fair,
And Zephyros, the dragon proud, a love beyond compare.
Their story stands as testament, that love can conquer all,
In the land of Abeir-Toril, their legacy stands tall.
