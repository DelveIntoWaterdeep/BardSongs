In the deep and briny blue,
Two souls were fated to rendezvous,
A tortle pirate by the name of Tortuga,
And a sea elf ranger, fair Aleria.

Oh, their love knew no bounds, like the ocean's expanse,
A tale of passion, of fate's sweet dance,
The Ballad of Tortuga and Aleria we sing,
A love unfathomable, let the oceans ring!

Tortuga's shell was hard and true,
A pirate's heart, born to pursue,
He sailed the seas, his treasure to find,
But it was love that stole his heart and mind.

Aleria, a ranger, so swift and so fair,
Tamed the wild depths with skill and care,
A guardian of the deep, she fought with grace,
But found a new battle in Tortuga's embrace.

Oh, their love knew no bounds, like the ocean's expanse,
A tale of passion, of fate's sweet dance,
The Ballad of Tortuga and Aleria we sing,
A love unfathomable, let the oceans ring!

In stormy waters, they would confide,
Their love a beacon, a guiding light,
When sea and sky seemed to conspire,
Together they'd face the tempest's ire.

Their love a legend, a sailor's tale,
A testament of strength that would not fail,
Against all odds, they'd fiercely fight,
For a love that would endure the darkest night.

And so it was, and ever shall be,
A tale of love that conquered the sea,
A tortle pirate and a sea elf ranger,
Bound by a love that could weather all danger.

Oh, their love knew no bounds, like the ocean's expanse,
A tale of passion, of fate's sweet dance,
The Ballad of Tortuga and Aleria we sing,
A love unfathomable, let the oceans ring!

Now gather 'round, ye sailors and kin,
As we toast to love that shall never dim,
For Tortuga and Aleria, forever entwined,
A love as deep and as vast as the brine.
