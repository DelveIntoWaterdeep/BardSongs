In the heart of the enchanted glade,
Where sunlight dances and shadows fade,
There dwells a druid, gentle and true,
A master of nature, and love's sweet muse.

With a touch of her hand, and a whisper so fair,
She calls forth flowers, blossoming everywhere,
A symphony of colors, a fragrant delight,
The druid's love blooms, in the soft moonlight.

Oh, sing me the tale of the druid divine,
Whose heart beats in rhythm with the earth's sweet time,
A love story, ancient as the stars above,
The druid and her flowers, entwined in love.

Her eyes hold the secrets of the deep forest green,
Her hair flows like rivers, a shimmering sheen,
Her touch brings life to the barren and bare,
Her love is a gift, like a breath of fresh air.

In the arms of her lover, she weaves her spell,
A cloak of petals, in love's sweet embrace,
As they dance to the music of the rustling leaves,
Love takes root, and together they believe.

Oh, sing me the tale of the druid divine,
Whose heart beats in rhythm with the earth's sweet time,
A love story, ancient as the stars above,
The druid and her flowers, entwined in love.

Under the canopy of the moonlit skies,
Their love blossoms like the flowers, so wise,
The mysteries of nature, they share and learn,
Two hearts entwined, as the seasons turn.

As time marches on, their love grows strong,
Together they flourish, where they belong,
The druid and her lover, in harmony,
A living testament to love's sweet decree.

In the sacred grove, where life is renewed,
The druid's song echoes, a melody imbued,
With love's pure power, it resonates,
The blossoming of flowers, a love that never abates.

Oh, sing me the tale of the druid divine,
Whose heart beats in rhythm with the earth's sweet time,
A love story, ancient as the stars above,
The druid and her flowers, entwined in love.

And so, in the glade, their love story thrives,
A testament to love, eternal as the skies,
Forever they'll dance, as the flowers bloom,
The druid and her lover, in love's sweet cocoon.
