In the cool and verdant woodland, 'neath the ancient canopy,
Lived a graceful wood elf druid, by the name of Deanna, free.
With a heart as wild as rivers, and a spirit like the breeze,
She whispered to the forest, and conversed with ancient trees.

From the realm of star-crossed bloodlines, walked a half-elf named Solao,
With a lute strung on his shoulder, and his eyes with soft glow.
A bard of High Elf ancestry, with songs that touched the stars,
He traveled through the night and day, his music heard afar.

Oh, they danced under moonlight, and they laughed under the sun,
Two souls entwined in melody, two hearts now beating as one.
In the heartwood, they found harmony, in love's enchanting dance,
A druid and a bard, they fell, victims of sweet romance.

In the hush of twilight's whisper, Solao strummed a gentle tune,
While Deanna's magic swirled around, beneath the silver moon.
In Waterdeep, they made their home, the city's heart their stage,
At the Font, they shared their stories, in laughter and sage.

The Yawning Portal knew them well, their voices graced its halls,
With tales of love and bravery, echoing off the walls.
Through cobblestone and cityscape, their melody would weave,
A testament to love's sweet song, that only hearts believe.

Oh, they danced under moonlight, and they laughed under the sun,
In Waterdeep's embracing walls, two hearts now beating as one.
At the Font and the Yawning Portal, their love story advanced,
A druid and a bard in sync, in life's enchanting dance.

From the heartwood to the city, their journey thus unfurled,
Two halves of the same melody, in this vast and endless world.
Through laughter and through song, their love story was told,
A tale of a druid and a bard, of hearts brave and bold.

Oh, they danced under the starlight, and they sang under the sun,
In the heart of Waterdeep, two souls now truly one.
In the heartwood, they found harmony, in the city, a loving trance,
A druid and a bard, bound in destiny's dance.

So here's to Deanna and Solao, may their song never end,
In the heartwood or in Waterdeep, love's melody they'll send.
With each note and whispered wind, with each loving glance,
They live their ever-echoing song, in love's enchanting dance.
