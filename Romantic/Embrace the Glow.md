In the quiet night, where the stars gleam bright,
A love story begins, beneath the pale moonlight.
A tale untold, a serenade so sweet,
In the soft embrace of the night, our hearts meet.

The snow may fall, and the winds may blow,
But in this moment, love begins to grow.
A whispered promise, forever to hold,
In the gentle warmth of a love untold.

Embrace the glow, let our love flow,
Underneath the moon's enchanting show.
In this moment, together we'll stand,
Hand in hand, in a winter wonderland.

Through the frosty air, our spirits take flight,
As we dance beneath the shimmering starlight.
A love so pure, like fresh-fallen snow,
In the magic of the night, our hearts aglow.

The world may freeze, and time may slow,
But in this love, a fire starts to grow.
A whispered promise, forever to hold,
In the gentle warmth of a love untold.

Embrace the glow, let our love flow,
Underneath the moon's enchanting show.
In this moment, together we'll stand,
Hand in hand, in a winter wonderland.

The cold may bite, but our love is strong,
In this frozen world, we both belong.
With you by my side, through ice and through snow,
Together we'll weather the coldest of woe.

Embrace the glow, let our love flow,
Underneath the moon's enchanting show.
In this moment, together we'll stand,
Hand in hand, in a winter wonderland.
