In the Spine of the World, where the mountains touch the skies,
Lies a tale untold, of the end of days, and the heroes who'd arise.
From the deepest dark, rose a drow of legend, Drizzt his name,
With eyes of lavender, a heart of gold, and a spirit like a flame.

Sing of their valor, their courage and might,
The heroes who stood, to turn back the night.
A drow named Drizzt, with lavender eyes,
Led the charge, where the end of days lies.

In the battle for the realm, the heroes faced the unknown,
Ancient evils, dark and vast, from the shadows they were thrown.
But united they stood, with the drow at their head,
Fighting to save the world, from a fate worse than dread.

Sing of their valor, their courage and might,
The heroes who stood, to turn back the night.
A drow named Drizzt, with lavender eyes,
Led the charge, where the end of days lies.

The world on the edge of destruction, the fate of all in their hands,
Their journey long and treacherous, through frozen wastes and burning sands.
But the heroes never faltered, with Drizzt lighting the way,
Determined to vanquish the darkness, and bring forth a brighter day.

And so the end of days was halted, by the heroes' unyielding stand,
The world saved by their sacrifice, their legend etched in the sand.
With Drizzt and his companions, forever we shall sing,
Of the day the world was saved, and the hope their deeds did bring.

Sing of their valor, their courage and might,
The heroes who stood, to turn back the night.
A drow named Drizzt, with lavender eyes,
Led the charge, where the end of days lies.

Now raise your voice in gratitude, to those who fought so true,
For in the Spine of the World, a new dawn broke, and the skies turned blue.
The end of days, forevermore, held back by heroes' might,
With Drizzt and his companions, we sing into the night.
