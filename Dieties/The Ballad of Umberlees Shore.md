Upon the golden shores we rove, where waves do dance and play,
A tale of love and mystery, beneath the sun's warm ray.
The Queenspire stands, a beacon bright, against the azure sky,
A story spun of magic, and the power of the tide.

Oh, Umberlee's Shore, where legends are born,
A tale of love and sorrow, the Queenspire does adorn.
A melody of hope, in the crashing waves' embrace,
The Ballad of Umberlee's Shore, forever sings its grace.

The goddess of the raging sea, Umberlee, her name,
A force of nature, fierce and free, her heart a burning flame.
In days of old, her love was scorned, her wrath it did ignite,
A storm to shake the very earth, the sea's dark fury alight.

Oh, Umberlee's Shore, where legends are born,
A tale of love and sorrow, the Queenspire does adorn.
A melody of hope, in the crashing waves' embrace,
The Ballad of Umberlee's Shore, forever sings its grace.

And there upon the shore did stand, a queen both strong and fair,
With courage bold, she faced the storm, and tamed the goddess' snare.
Their hearts entwined, a love reborn, a truce forever sealed,
The Queenspire rose, a testament, their love for all revealed.

Now on these shores, we celebrate, the love that conquered all,
A beacon of hope and unity, the Queenspire stands tall.
In every note, the song we sing, their story we shall share,
The Ballad of Umberlee's Shore, a love beyond compare.

Oh, Umberlee's Shore, where legends are born,
A tale of love and sorrow, the Queenspire does adorn.
A melody of hope, in the crashing waves' embrace,
The Ballad of Umberlee's Shore, forever sings its grace.

We gather here on sandy shores, where once the storm did rage,
To sing of love's eternal power, its mark upon this age.
In friendship, joy, and unity, we dance upon the strand,
As laughter rings, and music sings, in this enchanted land.

Oh, Umberlee's Shore, where legends are born,
A tale of love and sorrow, the Queenspire does adorn.
A melody of hope, in the crashing waves' embrace,
The Ballad of Umberlee's Shore, forever sings its grace.

Now let our voices rise as one, a chorus to the skies,
In honor of the love that binds, and never truly dies.
And though the tides may ebb and flow, and storms may come and go,
The Ballad of Umberlee's Shore, forever we shall know.
